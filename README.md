# Student_performancePrediction
Using data science methodology and predictive analysis to predict student performance

step 1 `Defining problem` == `Predict final grade (G3)`  
step 2 `Import dataset` from `https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance`  
step 3 `Wrangling`  
step 4 `EDA and Outliers detection`  
step 5 `Feature Engineering`  
step 6 `Pre-Processing`  
step 7 `Appling machine learning algorithms`   

note: **I will back with new approaches coming soon... :smiley:**
